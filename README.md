# typescript-starter

A basic typescript starter/sandbox project, with a minimum amount of dependencies and no framework.

Make your first edits in `src/index.ts` and `src/index.html` and go from there.

## Running

```npm run dev
```

## How does it work?

Nodemon runs the typescript transpiler, the http server and watches for changes to the files in the `src` folder.
